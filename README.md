I've abstracted some mathematical functions I've defined relating to catmull-rom spline creation and working with irregular shapes defined from closed splines including pointInTriange / pointInTrianges to simulate pointIn (irregular shape area)

This is pretty raw as I've ripped it out of a private repo I'm working on. Currently a WIP. I may or may not keep this public version updated
